This is part II in a series of posts about using RStudio on Amazon Web Services (AWS). In [part I](http://strimas.com/r/rstudio-cloud/), I outlined how to quickly get RStudio Server running on an AWS EC2 instance. This gives you access to RStudio via a web browser with as much (or as little) computing power you need for any given task.

Once you have RStudio up and running, you'll likely want to transfer or sync some data and/or code between the remote AWS instance and your local machine. This tutorial covers this syncing process.

# Syncing Code with AWS

There isn't much to say here other than: use **git** and (**GitHub**)[https://github.com/]. These tools are specifically designed for version control and colloborative coding. Furthermore, (RStudio)[https://www.rstudio.com/] has great intergration with git and GitHub. If you're new to these tools, there are many great tutorials online. [Jenny Bryan's notes](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/git00_index.html) for STAT545 at UBC are an excellent place to start.

# Syncing Data with AWS

There are a variety of approaches for syncing or transferring data between an EC2 instance and a local computer. I'll cover three options here: using [Secure Copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy) (SCP) to copy files over SSH, syncing files with [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), and using Amazon S3 and AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). Each has it's own benefits and drawbacks.

## SCP

## Dropbox

## S3

Once you have an RStudio project that you've pushed to GitHub, point your browser to your EC2 instance and log on to RStudio Server ([covered in part I](http://strimas.com/r/rstudio-cloud/)).

```bash
ssh -i ~/aws.pem ubuntu@ec2-52-36-52-70.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```
