# Syncing Data with AWS

There are a variety of approaches for syncing or transferring data between an EC2 instance and a local computer. I'll cover three options here: using [Secure Copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy) (SCP) to copy files over SSH, syncing files with [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), and using Amazon S3 and the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). Each has it's own benefits and drawbacks.

## Example

I've created a [simple RStudio project](https://github.com/mstrimas/aws-example) for demonstration purposes. It contains a data set taken from the UN [Food and Agriculture Organization's](http://www.fao.org/home/en/) [Forest Resources Assessment](http://www.fao.org/forest-resources-assessment/explore-data/en/). [Download](https://github.com/mstrimas/aws-example/archive/master.zip) and unzip the project before you continue.

The `forest-loss.r` script reads in the data, processes it, and produces a figures, which is saved as a PNG file.


## SCP

[Secure Copy](http://www.hypexr.org/linux_scp_help.php) (SCP) is a means of transferring files over SSH between a local and remote host. This is a fairly simple process requiring no extra tools; however, it's a one time transfer, there's no syncing of files. This method is most useful for moving files (e.g. the output of a script you've just run) from AWS back to your local machine. 

### Copying to AWS

There is one important catch to SCP: you can only SSH into your EC2 instance as user `ubuntu`, but you can only login to RStudio as user `rstudio`. This means you can only SCP files to the home directory of `ubuntu`, which is inaccessible via RStudio. So, there's an extra step required to move files between home directories on the EC2 instance.

To transfer the example project folder from your local machine to an EC2 instance, open a terminal window on your local machine, navigate to the directory containing the project directory, and run the following command:

```bash
scp -i ~/aws.pem -r aws-example-master ubuntu@ec2-52-36-52-70.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~
```

Let's break this down:

- `-i ~/aws.pem` points SCP to your private key [required for logging on to the EC2 instance](http://strimas.com/r/rstudio-cloud-1/). Make sure you put in the correct path to your `.pem` file.
- `-r` tells SCP to copy recursively. This is only needed when copying directories and can be omitted if copying a single file.
- ` aws-example-master` this is the file or folder you want to copy.
- `ubuntu@...` specifies the user and host name for the remote instance. Make sure you substitute the public DNS of your instance, which is available via the *Instances* page in the *EC2 Console*.
- Finally, the portion after the colon specifies where on the remote host you want to put the file. Here I've just used `~` to put the project directory in the home directory.

Next, you'll need to log on to the EC2 instance and move the file from the `ubuntu` home directory to the `rstudio` home directory to make it accessible from RStudio.

```bash
ssh -i ~/aws.pem ubuntu@ec2-52-36-52-70.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
sudo mv aws-example-master/ ~rstudio
sudo chown rstudio ~rstudio/aws-example-master
```

The last command changes ownership of the directory from `ubuntu` to `rstudio`. 

Now, log into your cloud-based RStudio using a web browser and open the RStudio project you just copied over. Within the `R/` directory there is a script named `forest-loss.r`, open and run the script. It will produce a single PNG file. The next step is to get this PNG file back onto our local machines.

### Copying from AWS

Copying files from AWS is much simpler since you don't have to deal with the extra steps of moving the files between home directories. Just run the following command at the shell prompt on your local machine:

```bash
scp -i ~/aws.pem ubuntu@ec2-52-36-52-70.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~rstudio/aws-example-master/forest-change.png .
```

Most of this command is identical to what we did previously when copying to AWS, with the following differences:

- `~rstudio/aws-example-master/forest-change.png` specifies that path to the file you want to copy on the remote host. Note that `~rstudio` refers to the home directory of user `rstudio` and is required because we're SCPing as user `ubuntu`.
- The `.` tells SCP to just put the file in the current directory. You could also specify the path to a directory on your local machine to put the file there instead.

# Create IAM user

The Identity and Access Management (IAM) service is used to manage users within an AWS account. Different permissions can be granted to different users for different resources. You can log on to AWS using the email address and password you provided when you signed up, which will give you full root access to your account; however, for security reasons, Amazon suggests creating a user with admin privileges and logging in as this user rather than with the root user credentials.

## Create user

Log in to the [AWS Console](console.aws.amazon.com) and click on the Identity & Access Management icon under *Security & Identity*.

<img src="/img/rstudio-cloud/iam-icon.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Click on *Users* in the left panel, then click the *New Users* button. Enter a sensible user name in the first box, check *Generate an access key for each user*, and click the *Create* button. On the next page click the *Download Credentials* button. This will download a `credentials.csv` file, which you should save somewhere safe.

<img src="/img/rstudio-cloud/new-iam-user.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Return to the *Users* page of the [IAM Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/). You should see the IAM user you just created listed here. Click the check box next to this user, then choose *Manage Password* from the *User Actions* dropdown, and assign a password.

## Assign permissions

The user you just created will need administrator privileges. To do this you'll need to create a group with these privileges, then add the user to this group. Return to the [IAM Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/), select *Groups* in the left panel, then click the *Create New Goup* button. You'll be prompted to enter a group name, use `administrators`, or something similar. On the next page, click the check box next to `AdministratorAccess`. Finally, click the *Create Group* button.

Return to the [*Groups*](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#groups) page of the IAM dashboard. Click on the group you just created, click the blue *Add Users to Group* button, and and choose the user you created.

## Log in with IAM user

Return to the front page of the [IAM Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/). At the top of the page there is a URL that you'll use to log on to AWS as an IAM user. If you want, this can be customized to something easier to remember.

<img src="/img/rstudio-cloud/iam-login-page.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Visit the login URL (bookmark it now!) and enter the user name and password for the IAM user you just created. In general, when using AWS you should log in in this way.
