This is the second in a series of posts about using PostgreSQL and PostGIS as a spatial database management system. In the [previous post](http://strimas.com/spatial/r-postgis-1/), I outlined how to get PostgreSQL/PostGIS set up on a Mac and how to get R talking to PostgreSQL. In this post, I'll outline the spatial data types that are availble for representing geographical features.

# Before we start

## SQL

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language specifically designed for querying relational databases. All the major relational database management systems use SQL, including PostgreSQL, so you'll need to have at least some familiarity with it if you want to use PostGIS. Fortunately, it's an easy language to learn and there are a variety of great tutorials online, for example the [one from w3 school](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp) is good.

## Interacting with PostgreSQL

The focus of this series of posts will be on using R as a front end for PostGIS, however, a standard installation of PostgreSQL comes with two handy tools for interacting with PostgreSQL databases. **psql** is a command-line based client for working with PostgreSQL databases. **pgAdmin** is a full featured, cross-platform GUI client for PostgreSQL. You can visually explore the structure of your database and run SQL queries on tables within the database. For this post, I'll take a break from R, and work with pgAdmin.

It's worth noting that pgAdmin is not a GIS, so you won't be able to look at your spatial features visually using this tool. Fortunately, the open source GIS software [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/) offers a great GUI interface for working with spatial features in a PostGIS databse.

## Creating a PostGIS-enabled database

For this tutorial, we'll need a PostgreSQL database with the PostGIS extension enabled. I covered how to do this in the previous post, but to recap, just run the following SQL statements to create a PostGIS-enabled database named `gistest`:

```sql
-- Create a new database
CREATE DATABASE gistest;
-- Enable PostGIS
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
-- Enable Topology
CREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology;
```

# Geometry data types

In relational databases, collections of related data are stored in **tables**, which are composed of **rows** and **columns**. Each **column** (or **variable**) contains values of the same type that measure the same underlying attribute or property. Meanwhile, each **row** (or **observation**) contains values that belong to the same unit or entity. For example, in a table of birds, each row could correspond to a different bird species, while columns would measure attributes of those species (mass, habitat, diet, conservation status, etc.).

| species              | family       | habitat    | mass_grams | threatened |
|----------------------|--------------|------------|:----------:|:----------:|
| Blackburnian Warbler | Parulidae    | forest     |     10     |    FALSE   |
| Northern Pintail     | Anatidae     | lakes      |    1000    |    FALSE   |
| Snowy Plover         | Charadriidae | shorelines |     45     |    TRUE    |

Notice that each columns consists of values of the same data type (character, numeric, logical, etc.). PostGIS extends PostgreSQL to include an additional **geometry** data type, which allows tables to store geographical features in addition to attribute data. Creating a new table in your database with a geometry column is simple:

```sql
CREATE TABLE spatial_table (id integer, name varchar, geom geometry);
```

Geometry columns, like shapefiles, are designed to store vector geometries, i.e. points, lines, and polygons. However, unlike shapefiles, PostGIS geometry columns can contain a mixture of different geometry types. For example, in a single column, one value might be a point while another might be a polygon.

## Simple Features and Well-known Text

The geometry data type in PostGIS is based on the [**Simple Features for SQL**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features) standard developed by the [Open Geospatial Consortium(OGC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Geospatial_Consortium) as a standardized way of storing and accessing spatial data in a relational database. This standard defines a variety of feature types that can be stored in geometry columns, including the familiar points, lines, and polygons. Internally, PostGIS stores geometry objects in binary format that is not human-readable, however, the OGC has also defined a human-readable markup language for representing geometries: Well-known Text (WKT). For example, a point would be represented by `POINT (30 10)`. Geometry objects can be added to or output from a PostGIS in this standard format.

## Geometry primitives

Vector geometries represent real-world objects as simple geometric abstractions. The basic geometry primitives that make up these abstractions are: points, linestrings (aka lines), and polygons. A **point** consists of a single X and Y coordinate, a **linestring** is an ordered series of points representing a path between locations, and a **polygon** is a closed linestring with the same start and end points, possibly with interior holes composed of other closed linestrings. The WKT representation of these geometry types is as follows<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>:

```
POINT(30 10)
LINESTRING(30 10, 10 30, 40 40)
# simple polygon
POLYGON((30 10, 40 40, 20 40, 10 20, 30 10))
# polygon with interior hole
POLYGON((35 10, 45 45, 15 40, 10 20, 35 10), (20 30, 35 35, 30 20, 20 30))
```

To insert these features into our PostGIS database, run the following SQL query:

```sql
INSERT INTO spatial_table VALUES
  (1, 'point', 'POINT(30 10)'),
  (2, 'line', 'LINESTRING(30 10, 10 30, 40 40)'),
  (3, 'polygon-simple',
      'POLYGON((30 10, 40 40, 20 40, 10 20, 30 10))'),
  (4, 'polygon-hole', 
      'POLYGON((35 10, 45 45, 15 40, 10 20, 35 10),(20 30, 35 35, 30 20, 20 30))');
```

To query this table and return the features in WKT format, we can use the `ST_AsText()` function as follows:

```sql
SELECT name, ST_AsText(geom) FROM spatial_table;
```

## Multipart geometries

In addition to the aforementioned geometry primitives, PostGIS allows for composite geometries consisting of collections of geometry primitives. The **MultiPoint**, **MultiLinstring**, and **MultiPolygon** types are collections of multiple points, linestrings, and polygons, respectively. In addition, a **GeometryCollection** is a heterogeneous collection of any other geometry, including geometry primitives and multipart geometries. The WKT representation of these geometry types is as follows<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>:

```
MULTIPOINT(10 40, 40 30, 20 20, 30 10)
MULTILINESTRING((10 10, 20 20, 10 40), (40 40, 30 30, 40 20, 30 10))
# mutlipolygon with the second polygon having an interior hole
MULTIPOLYGON(((40 40, 20 45, 45 30, 40 40)),
             ((20 35, 10 30, 10 10, 30 5, 45 20, 20 35), (30 20, 20 15, 20 25, 30 20)))
GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POINT(4 6), LINESTRING(4 6,7 10))
```

Note that these multipart geometries store multiple primtives in as a single cell value in a table, which is distinct from a column with multiple cells each of which stores a single primitive. For example, if a researcher was studying the nesting behaviour of birds, they might have a `nest` table where each row corresponds to a single nest with the nest's location in a geometry column. Alternatively, the researcher might have a `bird` table in which each row corresponds to a single bird, which could have multiple nests all stored as a single MultiPoint geometry. PostGIS also supports other, more esoteric geometry types, including curves and 3D geometries, however, for most purposes the geometries I've defined above are more than sufficient.

Let's insert examples of these geometry types into the PostGIS database:

```sql
INSERT INTO spatial_table VALUES
  (5, 'multipoint', 'MULTIPOINT(10 40, 40 30, 20 20, 30 10)'),
  (6, 'multilinestring', 'MULTILINESTRING((10 10, 20 20, 10 40), (40 40, 30 30, 40 20, 30 10))'),
  (7, 'multipolygon', 
      'MULTIPOLYGON(((40 40, 20 45, 45 30, 40 40)), ((20 35, 10 30, 10 10, 30 5, 45 20, 20 35), (30 20, 20 15, 20 25, 30 20)))'),
  (8, 'geometrycollection', 'GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POINT(4 6), LINESTRING(4 6,7 10))');
```

We can now query this table to return the geometry type of each row:

```sql
SELECT id, name, ST_GeometryType(geometry) FROM spatial_table;
```

| id | name               | st_geometrytype       | 
|----|--------------------|-----------------------| 
| 1  | point              | ST_Point              | 
| 2  | line               | ST_LineString         | 
| 3  | polygon-simple     | ST_Polygon            | 
| 4  | polygon-hole       | ST_Polygon            | 
| 5  | multipoint         | ST_MultiPoint         | 
| 6  | multilinestring    | ST_MultiLineString    | 
| 7  | multipolygon       | ST_MultiPolygon       | 
| 8  | geometrycollection | ST_GeometryCollection | 

# Spatial reference systems

In the above examples, we've created geometries based on coordinates, however, we haven't defined what these coordinates refer to. A **spatial reference system (SRS)** is a system that maps 2-dimensional coordinates to geographical locations on the earth's surface. It defines both a geographic coordinate system (the system for representing locations on the earth as coordinates) and, often, a map projection (a transormation between geographic coordinates and locations on a plane). Without an SRS there is no way to tie a point such as `POINT(30 10)` to an actual location on the earth. Is this point located at 30°E 10°N or 30km west and 10km north of some reference point, or something else entirely.

The OGC has created a standardized way to encode all the information necessary to define an SRS and each SRS has been assigned a Spatial Reference ID (SRID), a unique number that can unambiguously identify an SRS. The website [spatialreference.org](http://spatialreference.org/) has compiled information on a wide variety projections and coordinate systems and can be useful in finding the SRID for a projection.

In PostGIS, we assign an SRS to a geometry feature using the SRID. Every PostGIS-enabled database has a table named `spatial_ref_sys` that contains all the spatial reference systems recognizable by that database. To take a look at the first few records of this table run:

```
SELECT srid, srtext, proj4text FROM spatial_ref_sys LIMIT 5;
```

The `srid` column gives the SRID of the projection, `srtext` gives the full definition in the OGC's Well-known Text format, and `proj4text` gives the more compact [PROJ.4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROJ.4) representation of the projection.

## Working with coordinate systems in PostGIS

I previously inserted new rows with geometry columns into our example table using the WKT representation of these geometries. A slight modification of this syntax can be used to assign an SRID to the geometry. In particular, I use the function `ST_GeomFromText(text WKT, integer srid)` where the SRID is supplied as the second arguement:

```sql
INSERT INTO spatial_table VALUES
  (9, 'point', ST_GeomFromText('POINT(-123.12 49.28)', 4326)),
  (10, 'point', ST_GeomFromText('POINT(491272.2 5458589.7)', 26910));
```

Here I've created two points, the first of which is in [unprojected WGS 84 coordinates](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84/) (`srid = 4326`) and gives the location of  Vancouver in terms of latitude and longitude. The second point is actually the same geographical location, but given at [UTM Zone 10 N](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/nad83-utm-zone-10n/) coordinates (`srid = 26910`), where the numbers represent the number of meters from an arbitrary reference meridian and the equator, respectively.

The SRID of a geometry object can be determined with the `ST_SRID()` function:

```sql
SELECT id, name, ST_GeometryType(geom), ST_SRID(geom) FROM spatial_table;
```

| id | name               | st_geometrytype       | st_srid | 
|----|--------------------|-----------------------|---------| 
| 1  | point              | ST_Point              | 0       | 
| 2  | line               | ST_LineString         | 0       | 
| 3  | polygon-simple     | ST_Polygon            | 0       | 
| 4  | polygon-hole       | ST_Polygon            | 0       | 
| 5  | multipoint         | ST_MultiPoint         | 0       | 
| 6  | multilinestring    | ST_MultiLineString    | 0       | 
| 7  | multipolygon       | ST_MultiPolygon       | 0       | 
| 8  | geometrycollection | ST_GeometryCollection | 0       | 
| 9  | point              | ST_Point              | 4326    | 
| 10 | point              | ST_Point              | 26910   | 

Note that the first 8 entries have `srid = 0`, this is because I didn't specify their SRID when I inserted the rows into this table, hence their SRID defaulted to 0 indicating that no projection has been assigned. We can update these geometry objects to assign an SRID, for example to use unprojected coordinates:

```sql
UPDATE spatial_table
-- update the srid
SET geom  = ST_SetSRID(geom, 4326)
-- only alters rows that don't already have an srid assigned
WHERE ST_SRID(geom) = 0;
```

# Spatial constraints

We now have a table storing 7 different geometry types, in a variety of projections, in a single column. While there may be some real-world cases in which you'd want such a hodge-podge of different geometries, in general it's best to have columns only contain a single geometry type and a single projection. Fortunately, PostGIS allows you to impose constraints on geometry column to fix the geometry type, dimension, and SRID.

The easiest way to add spatial constraints to a geometry column is to create the column with the function `AddGeometryColumn()`. Start by creating the non-spatial part of the table, for example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE constrained_table (id integer, name varchar);
```

Now if we wanted to add a column that stores points in unprojected WGS 84 coordinates (`srid = 4326`) run:

```sql
SELECT AddGeometryColumn ('constrained_table', 'geom', 4326, 'POINT', 2);
```

The first two arguments specify the names of the table and the column to be added, respectively. The remaining 3 arguments are, in order: the SRID, the geometry type, and the dimension the geometry (generally 2).

Now let's add a points to this table for the location of Vancouver:

```sql
INSERT INTO constrained_table VALUES
  (1, 'vancouver', ST_GeomFromText('POINT(-123.12 49.28)', 4326));
```

However, if I try to insert the UTM coordinates for the same point, I'll get an error because this column only accepts unprojected WGS 84 coordinates:

```sql
INSERT INTO constrained_table VALUES
  (2, 'vancouver utm', ST_GeomFromText('POINT(491272.2 5458589.7)', 26910));
-- ERROR: Geometry SRID (26910) does not match column SRID (4326)
```

Similarly, if I try to insert a linstring into this column I'll again get an error:
```sql
INSERT INTO constrained_table VALUES
  (2, 'line', ST_GeomFromText('LINESTRING(30 10, 10 30, 40 40)', 4326));
-- ERROR:  Geometry type (LineString) does not match column type (Point)
```
