I'm a Vancouver-based conservation researcher currently working on a master's in the [Zoology Department](http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/) at UBC. My research focuses on the effects of human-induced land use change on ecosystems and how protected areas can be used as a tool to mitigate these negative impacts. Prior to this, I studied physics at the undergraduate and graduate levels, which I credit with shaping how I think and how I approach problems.  

I'm a firm believer in incorporating decision science into conservation, an approach championed by researchers such as [Hugh Possingham](http://www.possinghamlab.org/). I believe in the importance of considering cost-benefit trade offs in conservation, taking a systematic approach to decision making, and in always prefacing ecological research by considering the potential management implications.  

In addition to my research interests, I get excited about open source software, spatial analysis, reproducible research, and writing code. My long term goal is to help conservation projects, large and small, by developing tools and providing technical expertise, particularly in the realm of spatial analysis and GIS. This desire stems from my observation that many projects have the ecological expertise to succeed, but are hindered by technical factors such as poor data management practices, inefficient use of available software tools, and inability to develop new software tools that are robust and flexible. These are the areas in which I excel and where I believe I can make the largest contribution to conservation.
