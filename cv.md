I'm a former physicist turned conservation researcher, and I'm currently looking for employment. My ideal job is working on conservation projects in a non-profit or government setting. I am broadly interested in wildlife and forest conservation, land use change, and systematic conservation planning. I love working with data, especially spatial data, to develop insights and guide conservation decision making. I am extremely adept at R, especially data analysis and visualization, GIS, modeling, and package development. I am familiar with many conservation-specific tools and techniques, such as  systematic reserve design with Marxan and species distribution modeling. However, what sets me apart more than anything else is my ability to quickly adapt to new situations and master new skills, whether it's a new software tool, programming language, or analytical technique.

I also see myself as someone who can make an important contribution facilitating conservation research by developing or implementing new tools and techniques. I can help set up databases to better manage spatial or ecological data, move analyses onto Amazon's cloud computing platform (AWS) to improve efficiency, or develop R packages to make analytical workflows more robust, efficient, and repeatable. I pride myself in being knowledgeable about best practices in programming and reproducible research, and I love passing this knowledge on to others. I've run workshops on collaborative coding with git and GitHub, cloud computing with Amazon Web Services, and a variety of R topics including effective data manipulation and spatial analysis and visualization in R.

If you think I might be a good fit for your project, take a look at my [CV](/assets/strimas-mackey_cv.pdf) or [send me an email](strimas@zoology.ubc.ca).
